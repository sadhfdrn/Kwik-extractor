# Overview

This is a minimal JavaScript console application that demonstrates basic Node.js functionality by outputting "hello world" to the console. The project serves as a simple starting point or template for JavaScript development.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Structure
- **Single-file application**: The entire application consists of one JavaScript file (`hello.js`)
- **Console-based output**: Uses Node.js's built-in `console.log()` function for output
- **No framework dependencies**: Pure JavaScript without external libraries or frameworks

## Runtime Environment
- **Node.js**: Designed to run in a Node.js environment
- **No build process**: Direct execution without compilation or bundling steps
- **Minimal setup**: Can be executed directly with `node hello.js`

## Design Patterns
- **Procedural programming**: Simple top-down execution without classes or modules
- **Immediate execution**: Code runs directly when the file is loaded

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Dependencies
- **Node.js**: Required JavaScript runtime environment

## No External Libraries
- No package.json file present
- No npm dependencies
- No third-party services or APIs
- No database connections
- No external integrations

This is a foundational template that can be extended with additional functionality, frameworks, or dependencies as needed.
